# Inventory Management System
In most developing countries such as ours, wholesale
businesses are still managed using a pen and paper
methodology even with the advent of the age of technology
and internet. This can sometimes leads to inefficient handling
of day- to-day business matters and can also lead to security
threats to the business due to the presence of physical
records.
This project aims to develop sales management web
application for a wholesale business to improve the
efficiency and security of the business. The lightweight
nature of the web application makes it ideal for small
businesses which cannot afford the expensive alternates
present in the market.
The Inventory or Wholesale Management System (WMS) has an
administrator login for the wholesaler with built-in features
to keep a check on the sales and the inventory so as to
efficiently run the sales division. The customers and suppliers
of the wholesale business can also be registered so as to
ensure the smooth functioning of sales. There is also a
customer login option which helps the customer in
monitoring his purchases from the wholesaler. By having the
above features, the WMS greatly simplifies the daily
functioning of the business.
Since, many developed countries already use such software
to speed up daily business activities; a lot of information is
available in the public domain regarding the desirable
structure of such software. We have used this information to
design and model our project.

SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
